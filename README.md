What is web2ldap?
-----------------

  * A generic LDAPv3 client which does not make any assumptions
    about the tree structure or LDAP schema.
  * Kind of a swiss-army knife for accessing/manipulating
    LDAP servers without having to configure anything.
  * A secure LDAP client with clean login behaviour.
  * A schema browser which displays references/dependencies
    within an LDAPv3 schema.
  * A customizable platform for prototyping LDAP administration use-cases.
  * For me it is a platform for implementing cutting edge LDAP features.
  * Continously maintained software since September 1998!
